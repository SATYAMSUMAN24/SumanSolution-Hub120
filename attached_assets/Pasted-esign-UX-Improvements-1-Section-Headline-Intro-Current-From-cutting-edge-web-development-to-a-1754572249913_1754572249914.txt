esign & UX Improvements
1. Section Headline & Intro
Current:
"From cutting-edge web development to advanced AI solutions..."

Suggestion:
Make the headline more actionable and bold. For example:

“Transforming Businesses Through Technology”
Empowering you with end-to-end development, automation, and AI-driven services.

Add a short CTA button like:
👉 “Get a Free Consultation” or “Explore Solutions”

2. Card Layout & Readability
Issue: The purple overlay background makes icons/text a bit less sharp.

Fix: Slightly increase contrast of text and icons.

Option: Add hover effects (e.g., lift or glow) to make each card interactive.

3. Icons
Use custom vector icons or minimal line icons to make the style feel more premium.

Add subtle animations on hover (e.g., rocket launch for Core Tech, pulse for AI, etc.)

4. Responsiveness
Make sure this grid is:

Single-column on mobile

Centered and scroll-friendly

Padding between badges should be consistent on smaller screens
